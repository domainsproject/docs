No dashboards, no forms — just fork, configure, and submit a pull request.

---

## 1. Set up your environment

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the repository">
    Start by forking our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourorg/register).  
    This creates your own copy where you’ll add your subdomain config.

    Once forked, clone it locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/register.git
    cd register
    ```

    If you prefer, you can also edit directly on GitHub via the web UI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-code" title="Create your subdomain config">
    Inside the `domains/` folder, create a new JSON file named after the subdomain you want. For example:

    ```bash
    domains/yourname.json
    ```

    Example config:

    ```json
 {
    "description": "Project Description",
    "domain": "is-not-a.dev",
    "subdomain": "example",

    "owner": {
        "repo": "https://github.com/username/repo",
        "email": "hello@example.com"
    },

    "record": {
        "A": ["1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"],
        "AAAA": ["::1", "::2"],
        "CNAME": "example.com",
        "MX": ["mx1.example.com", "mx2.example.com"],
        "TXT": ["example_verification=1234567890"],
        "CAA": [
            { "flags": 0, "tag": "issue", "value": "letsencrypt.org" },
            { "flags": 0, "tag": "issuewild", "value": "sectigo.com" }
        ],
        "SRV": [
            { "priority": 10, "weight": 60, "port": 5060, "target": "sipserver.example.com" },
            { "priority": 20, "weight": 10, "port": 5061, "target": "sipbackup.example.com" }
        ]
    },

    "proxied": false
}
    ```

    You can also use `A` or `TXT` records depending on your needs.  
    See the [Configuration](/configuration) guide for all supported formats.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Submit your request

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Open a pull request">
    After adding your config file, commit the change:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add yourname.owns.it.com"
    git push origin main
    ```

    Then go to your fork on GitHub and open a pull request to the original repo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Wait for approval">
    Once reviewed and approved by a maintainer, your PR will be merged.

    Within a few minutes, your subdomain will go live and be accessible via the DNS configuration you provided.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

---

## 3. You're live

Once merged, your subdomain will be active and pointing to your configured service (GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.).  
You can update or remove it at any time by submitting another pull request.
