## Coming Soon

We’re expanding the platform to support more developer-friendly domains. These will be curated based on community need, branding clarity, and technical reliability.

Here are some examples of domains that may be added:

- `is-a-builder.dev`
- `stack.site`
- `toolkit.page`
- `builds.dev`

Each new domain will follow the same Git-based submission process and remain free to use.

## Sponsor a Domain

We're opening up support for **domain sponsorships**. If you'd like to sponsor a root domain to appear here:

- The domain must be DNS-managed by you or delegated to us
- It must align with the values of this project (developer-friendly, safe, and meaningful)
- It will be reviewed and approved by project maintainers

Sponsors will be recognized on the [Supporters](/community/supporters) page and on this list once their domain goes live.

To sponsor a domain, [open an issue](https://github.com/domainsproject/register/issues) or [contact us directly](mailto:contact@tanvir.io).
