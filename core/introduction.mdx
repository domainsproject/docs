A free and open-source service offering developer-friendly subdomains under curated root domains.

Start by claiming a subdomain like `yourname.owns.it.com`, and use it for your personal site, open-source project, portfolio, or any public-facing tool. No cost, no tracking, no hidden catch — just a clean, GitHub-powered workflow.

## How it works

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="code-fork" title="1. Fork the repository">
    Go to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/domainsproject/register) and fork it to your GitHub account. This will create your own editable copy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-code" title="2. Add your subdomain config">
    In the `domains/` directory, create a new JSON file named after the subdomain you want (e.g., `yourname.json`). Inside, specify your DNS configuration such as a CNAME or A record.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="3. Submit a pull request">
    Commit and push your changes, then open a pull request to our main repository. Our maintainers will review and merge your PR.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="4. Your subdomain goes live">
    Once merged, your subdomain will be publicly accessible and automatically connected to the DNS record you specified.
  </Accordion>
