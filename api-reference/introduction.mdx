This section introduces the public API provided by the subdomain registry service.

The API allows developers to fetch a list of registered subdomains and use that data to build dashboards, search tools, or integrations. It's lightweight, read-only, and available without authentication.

---

## What the API does

The API exposes structured data about all public subdomains registered through the service. This includes:

- Subdomain names
- Target records (CNAME, A, etc.)
- Domain metadata

It's useful for:
- Building dashboards
- Monitoring usage
- Creating tools that reference or analyze active subdomains

---

## Current capabilities

The API currently supports one endpoint:

### GET `/api/domains`

Returns a list of registered subdomains and their DNS configurations.

### Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "subdomain": "yourname",
    "domain": "owns.it.com",
    "type": "CNAME",
    "value": "yourusername.github.io"
  },
  {
    "subdomain": "project123",
    "domain": "owns.it.com",
    "type": "A",
    "value": "192.0.2.1"
  }
]
```

## Planned improvements

Future endpoints may include:

- Domain availability checks
- Filters by domain or record type
- Domain usage statistics
- Authenticated endpoints for managing personal configs
