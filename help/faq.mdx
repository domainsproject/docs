<Accordion title="Which DNS record types are supported?">
We currently support the following DNS record types:
- `A` (IPv4)
- `AAAA` (IPv6)
- `CNAME` (alias)
- `TXT` (verification, metadata)
- `MX` (email servers)
- `SRV` (service location)
- `CAA` (certificate authority authorization)

See the [Configuration](/guides/configuration) page for examples.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does my domain still redirect to the project homepage?">
This usually means your DNS config hasn't been merged yet, or you're still seeing cached DNS records. Once your PR is merged, give DNS changes some time (up to a few hours) to propagate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use a CNAME record with other record types?">
No — DNS standards require that if you use a `CNAME`, it must be the **only** record for that subdomain. If you need multiple types (e.g., `A` + `TXT`), use `A` or `AAAA` instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long will it take for my pull request to get merged?">
Most pull requests are reviewed within **24–72 hours**. If you follow all guidelines and your config is valid, it’ll be merged as soon as possible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which hosting services are supported?">
You can use any service that supports custom domains, including:
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Cloudflare Pages
- Custom/self-hosted servers

Check out the [DNS & Hosting](/dns) guide for help setting these up.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I create nested subdomains (e.g. sub.project.owns.it.com)?">
No — at this time we only support **one-level subdomains** like `yourname.owns.it.com`. Nested or wildcard subdomains are not supported.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I get an SSL error on GitHub Pages. How do I fix this?">
Make sure your GitHub repository has a `CNAME` file with your full subdomain and that GitHub Pages is configured to enforce HTTPS. Also confirm your DNS `CNAME` is correctly set.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I join the maintainer or moderation team?">
We’re always open to thoughtful contributors. Open an issue or contribute consistently, and we’ll reach out if a maintainer spot opens up.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I accidentally leaked sensitive info in my PR. Can it be deleted?">
Yes. Immediately **close the PR** and open an issue or email us. We’ll help you remove the content from commit history as needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use my subdomain for a Minecraft server?">
Yes, but you’ll need to use an `A` record pointing to your server’s IP address. Just make sure it doesn’t violate any of our rules.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who can use NS records?">
We do **not support NS records** for custom delegation. All DNS is centrally managed by us to ensure stability and prevent abuse.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are you strict with NS records?">
Allowing NS records opens up the potential for abuse, including unrestricted wildcard subdomains or spammy behavior. By managing DNS centrally, we maintain security and trust across all domains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I update or delete my subdomain?">
To update your subdomain, simply open another pull request modifying your existing config file.

To delete it, remove the file and open a PR with a message like `remove yourname.owns.it.com`.
