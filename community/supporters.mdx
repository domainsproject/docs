This project is free and open-source — but it still takes time, infrastructure, and ongoing work to keep it running.  

We're grateful to those who support us financially, logistically, or by contributing services.

If you'd like to support the project, you can help in a few ways: sponsor a domain, donate, or contribute your time.

## Sponsor a domain

Have a short, developer-friendly domain you'd like to share with the community?

We welcome sponsors who can provide and maintain additional root domains that subdomains can be registered under.

To sponsor a domain:

- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/domainsproject/register/issues)
- Or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/jtVHRF9CdK)
- We'll help you onboard and configure it properly

Sponsored domains are:
- Publicly listed on the [Domains](/core/domains) page
- Available for free use by developers
- DNS-managed by us or co-managed by you
