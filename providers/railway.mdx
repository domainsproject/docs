# Setting up Railway with an owns.it.com subdomain

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Railway deployment and pointing your owns.it.com subdomain towards it.

## Get the CNAME Record

First, you'll need to get the CNAME record from Railway:

1. Go to the [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Select your service
4. Switch to the **Settings** tab
5. Click the **+ Custom Domain** button
6. Enter your owns.it.com subdomain
7. Copy the **Value** field provided by Railway

## Create the Domain File

Create a JSON file inside the domains directory (`domains/subdomain.json`) with the following content and submit a pull request:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-github-username",
        "email": "your-email@example.com"
    },
    "records": {
        "CNAME": "the-value-railway-gave-you"
    }
}
```

Replace:
- `your-github-username` with your GitHub username
- `your-email@example.com` with your email address
- `the-value-railway-gave-you` with the CNAME value you copied from Railway

**Important**: Since the Railway CNAME value doesn't show your actual website, you must include a preview of your website in your pull request.

## Your website should be live!

After your pull request has been merged, your website should be accessible at your owns.it.com subdomain. The process may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate.

### Troubleshooting

If your site isn't working:
1. Check that your domain file is correctly formatted
2. Verify that the CNAME record matches exactly what Railway provided
3. Confirm that your domain is properly added in Railway's settings
4. Wait for DNS changes to propagate (this can take up to 48 hours)
5. Check that your Railway service is running correctly

If you've waited 48 hours and the DNS records haven't updated:
1. Verify your Railway service is still active
2. Check that the custom domain is properly configured in Railway
3. Create an issue for support if problems persist
