# Setting up Cloudflare Pages with an owns.it.com subdomain

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Cloudflare Pages website and pointing your owns.it.com subdomain towards it.

## Create a Cloudflare Pages Website

First, you'll need to create a website on Cloudflare Pages:

1. Go to the [Cloudflare Pages Getting Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started)
2. Follow the instructions to create and deploy your site
3. Note down your site's URL (it will be in the format `your-sitename.pages.dev`)

## Point your subdomain to your Cloudflare Pages site

Next, you'll need to point your owns.it.com subdomain to your Cloudflare Pages website:

1. Go to the [Cloudflare Pages Custom Domains Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/custom-domains)
2. Follow only the "Add a custom domain" section
3. Use your owns.it.com subdomain (e.g., `yourname.owns.it.com`) as the custom domain
4. Return to this guide for the next steps

## Create the Domain File

In the domains directory, create a new JSON file for your subdomain (`domains/subdomain.json`) and submit a pull request. This file should contain the following:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-github-username",
        "email": "your-email@example.com"
    },
    "records": {
        "CNAME": "your-sitename.pages.dev"
    }
}
```

Replace:
- `your-github-username` with your GitHub username
- `your-email@example.com` with your email address
- `your-sitename.pages.dev` with your Cloudflare Pages site URL

## Your website should be live!

After your pull request has been merged, your website should be accessible at your owns.it.com subdomain. The process may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate.

### Troubleshooting

If your site isn't working:
1. Check that your domain file is correctly formatted
2. Verify that your Cloudflare Pages site is deployed and accessible
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate (this can take up to 48 hours)
4. Check the custom domain settings in your Cloudflare Pages project
