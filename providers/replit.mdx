# Setting up Replit with an owns.it.com subdomain

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Replit project and pointing your owns.it.com subdomain towards it.

## Create a Replit Project

First, you'll need to create a project on Replit:

1. Go to the [Replit Workspace Guide](https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/creating-a-repl)
2. Follow the instructions to create your project
3. Make sure your project is deployed and running

## Connect Your Domain to Replit

Next, you'll need to connect your owns.it.com subdomain to your Replit project:

1. Go to the [Replit Custom Domains Guide](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/hosting-web-pages#custom-domains)
2. Follow only the "Connecting your domain to your repl" section
3. Copy your Replit domain (it will be in the format `siteid.id.repl.co`)
4. Return to this guide for the next steps

**Important**: Do not add any TXT records, even if Replit instructs you to do so.

## Create the Domain File

Create a JSON file inside the domains directory (`domains/subdomain.json`) with the following content and submit a pull request:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-github-username",
        "email": "your-email@example.com"
    },
    "records": {
        "CNAME": "siteid.id.repl.co"
    }
}
```

Replace:
- `your-github-username` with your GitHub username
- `your-email@example.com` with your email address
- `siteid.id.repl.co` with your Replit domain

## Your website should be live!

After your pull request has been merged, your website should be accessible at your owns.it.com subdomain. The process may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate.

### Troubleshooting

If your site isn't working:
1. Check that your domain file is correctly formatted
2. Verify that the CNAME record matches your Replit domain exactly
3. Confirm that your Replit project is running
4. Make sure your project's web server is configured correctly
5. Wait for DNS changes to propagate (this can take up to 48 hours)
