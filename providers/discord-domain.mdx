# Setting up Discord domain verification with your owns.it.com subdomain

This guide will walk you through the process of verifying your owns.it.com subdomain with Discord.

## Get your verification string

1. Open your Discord app and go to **Settings**
2. Navigate to the **Connections** section
3. Click the **View more** button
4. Click on the **domain button** (the globe icon)
5. In the field that appears, type your owns.it.com domain name (e.g., `example.owns.it.com`)
6. Copy the verification string that Discord provides

## Create the Domain File

Create a JSON file inside the domains directory (`domains/_discord.example.json`) with the following content and submit a pull request:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-github-username",
        "email": "your-email@example.com"
    },
    "records": {
        "TXT": "discord-verification-string"
    }
}
```

Replace:
- `your-github-username` with your GitHub username
- `your-email@example.com` with your email address
- `discord-verification-string` with the verification string you copied from Discord

## Verify your domain

After your pull request has been merged:
1. Return to Discord's domain verification page
2. Enter your owns.it.com domain again
3. Click the **Verify** button

### Troubleshooting

If your verification fails:
1. Check that your domain file is correctly formatted
2. Verify that the TXT record matches exactly what Discord provided
3. Wait for DNS changes to propagate (this can take up to 24 hours)
4. Try the verification process again after waiting

If you see an error like "Unable to verify your domain", this is usually because:
- DNS changes haven't fully propagated yet
- The verification string doesn't match exactly
- The domain file format is incorrect
