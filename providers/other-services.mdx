# Setting up other services with an owns.it.com subdomain

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your owns.it.com subdomain with any hosting service or server not covered by our other guides.

## Create the Domain File

Create a JSON file inside the domains directory (`domains/subdomain.json`) with the appropriate DNS records for your service. The file structure will depend on your hosting requirements:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-github-username",
        "email": "your-email@example.com"
    },
    "records": {
        "A": ["your-ipv4-address"],
        "AAAA": ["your-ipv6-address"],
        "CNAME": "your-hostname",
        "MX": ["your-mail-server"],
        "TXT": ["your-txt-record"]
    }
}
```

Replace the records section with only the DNS records required by your service. Common record types include:
- `A`: IPv4 address
- `AAAA`: IPv6 address
- `CNAME`: Hostname
- `MX`: Mail server
- `TXT`: Text records (often used for verification)

## Configure Your Server

After your pull request is merged:

1. Configure your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to handle requests for your owns.it.com subdomain
2. Update your SSL certificate to include your owns.it.com subdomain
3. Configure any additional service-specific settings

### Apache Configuration Example

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName your-subdomain.owns.it.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/your-site
    
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/certificate.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/private.key
</VirtualHost>
```

### Nginx Configuration Example

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-subdomain.owns.it.com;
    root /var/www/your-site;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
}
```

## SSL Certificate

To avoid certificate errors, make sure to:
1. Include your owns.it.com subdomain in your SSL certificate
2. Use a valid SSL certificate from a trusted provider
3. Keep your certificate up to date

## Your website should be live!

After completing all steps and your pull request has been merged, your website should be accessible at your owns.it.com subdomain. The process may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate.

### Troubleshooting

If your site isn't working:
1. Check that your domain file is correctly formatted
2. Verify that your DNS records are correct for your service
3. Confirm that your web server configuration is correct
4. Ensure your SSL certificate includes your subdomain
5. Wait for DNS changes to propagate (this can take up to 48 hours)
6. Check your web server logs for any errors

## Need Help?

If you need assistance:
1. Check your service provider's documentation
2. Review your web server's documentation ([Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/), [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/))
3. [Create an issue](https://github.com/owns-it-com/register/issues) for support with your specific setup

**Note**: Make sure to remove any sensitive information (like private keys or passwords) before sharing configurations when asking for help.
