# Setting up Codeberg Pages with an owns.it.com subdomain

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Codeberg Pages website and pointing your owns.it.com subdomain towards it.

## Create a Codeberg Pages Website

First, you'll need to create a website on Codeberg Pages:

1. Go to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) and sign in to your account
2. Create a new repository or use an existing one
3. Enable Codeberg Pages in your repository settings
4. Follow the [Codeberg Pages Guide](https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/) to set up your site
5. Note down your site's URL (it will be in the format `pages.your-codeberg-username.codeberg.page`)

## Create the Domain File

In the domains directory, create a new JSON file for your subdomain (`domains/subdomain.json`) and submit a pull request. This file should contain the following:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-codeberg-username",
        "email": "your-email@example.com"
    },
    "records": {
        "CNAME": "pages.your-codeberg-username.codeberg.page"
    }
}
```

Replace:
- `your-codeberg-username` with your Codeberg username
- `your-email@example.com` with your email address

## Add .domains File

After your pull request is merged, you'll need to configure Codeberg Pages to recognize your custom domain:

1. Create a `.domains` file in your repository's root directory
2. Add your owns.it.com subdomain (e.g., `your-subdomain.owns.it.com`) to the file
3. Commit and push the changes to your repository

Example `.domains` file content:
```plaintext
your-subdomain.owns.it.com
```

## Your website should be live!

After completing all steps and your pull request has been merged, your website should be accessible at your owns.it.com subdomain. The process may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate.

### Troubleshooting

If your site isn't working:
1. Check that your domain file is correctly formatted
2. Verify that your Codeberg Pages site is deployed and accessible at the original URL
3. Confirm that your `.domains` file exists and contains the correct domain
4. Wait a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate (this can take up to 48 hours)
5. Check the Pages settings in your Codeberg repository
