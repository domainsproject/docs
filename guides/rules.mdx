To keep the service free, open, and valuable for everyone, we ask that all users follow a few simple rules.

These help us maintain quality, ensure fair use, and protect the integrity of supported domains.

---

## âœ… Whatâ€™s allowed

- Personal portfolios, blogs, or dev journals.
- Open-source project websites or documentation.
- Public tools, APIs, and libraries.
- Hobby projects or experiments.
- Redirects to platforms you own (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
- Projects hosted on custom servers (with valid A or AAAA records).

---

## ðŸš« Whatâ€™s not allowed

- Malicious, deceptive, or phishing sites.
- NSFW, illegal, or violent content.
- Mass subdomain parking or automated domain farms.
- Trademark violations, impersonation, or brand squatting.
- SEO spam or cloaked redirect pages.
- Misuse of DNS records (e.g., pointing to domains/IPs you donâ€™t control).

---

## Naming guidelines

- Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes (`-`).
- Avoid overly generic names like `api`, `app`, or `site` unless they're clearly project-specific.
- Subdomains are granted on a first-come, first-served basis.
- Requests may be rejected or removed at the discretion of maintainers.

---

## One subdomain per project

You can request:

- One subdomain per person or portfolio.
- One subdomain per open-source project.

If you need more (e.g., for an org or platform), [open an issue](https://github.com/yourorg/register/issues) to discuss your use case.

---

## Moderation and removal

We reserve the right to:

- Deny or revoke subdomains that break the rules.
- Remove inactive or dead subdomains after reasonable time.
- Update our rules to keep the platform sustainable.
