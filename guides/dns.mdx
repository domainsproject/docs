This guide explains how DNS works in the context of your subdomain and how to connect it to popular hosting services like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or custom servers.

## How DNS works

When you register a subdomain like `yourname.owns.it.com`, we create DNS records based on the configuration file you provide. These records tell the internet how to route traffic to your website or app.

We support the following record types:

- `CNAME`: Points your subdomain to another domain (ideal for GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.)
- `A`: Points to an IPv4 address
- `AAAA`: Points to an IPv6 address
- `TXT`: Used for verification or domain metadata
- `MX`: Used for email servers
- `SRV`: Used for service-specific routing
- `CAA`: Used to authorize certificate authorities

You define these records in your config file under the `record` field.

## Hosting options

Here’s how to configure your subdomain to work with common hosting platforms:

### GitHub Pages

Use a `CNAME` record:

```json
"record": {
  "CNAME": "yourusername.github.io"
}
```

Make sure your GitHub repo has a `CNAME` file with your subdomain in it (e.g., `yourname.owns.it.com`).

### Vercel

Use a `CNAME` record pointing to your Vercel subdomain:

```json
"record": {
  "CNAME": "yourproject.vercel.app"
}
```

Then add the custom domain in your Vercel dashboard.

### Netlify

Use a `CNAME` record pointing to your Netlify subdomain:

```json
"record": {
  "CNAME": "yourproject.netlify.app"
}
```

Add the custom domain in your Netlify site settings.

### Custom server

Use an `A` (IPv4) or `AAAA` (IPv6) record pointing to your server's IP address:

```json
"record": {
  "A": ["192.0.2.123"]
}
```

or

```json
"record": {
  "AAAA": ["2001:db8::1"]
}
```

Ensure your server is properly configured to handle requests to your subdomain.

## SSL/TLS (HTTPS)

Most popular hosting providers will automatically issue an SSL certificate once the subdomain is correctly configured.

If you're self-hosting, you may use Let's Encrypt or a custom certificate. Make sure your server is reachable and serving a valid certificate.

---

## DNS propagation

Changes to DNS records can take a few minutes to a few hours to propagate globally. If you don’t see your domain resolving immediately, give it a bit of time and try again.
