To request a subdomain, you need to create a JSON configuration file that tells us how your subdomain should behave.

Each configuration file is added to the `domains/` directory in the repository and must be named after the subdomain you want to claim. For example, if you're requesting `yourname.owns.it.com`, your file should be:

```
domains/yourname.json
```

---

## Basic structure

Here's what a minimal configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "owner": {
    "email": "yourname@example.com"
  },
  "record": {
    "CNAME": "yourusername.github.io"
  }
}
```

- `owner.email` is required. This is used for internal communication if needed — it's not publicly displayed.
- `record` defines the DNS record we should create for your subdomain. We support `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `TXT`, `MX`, `SRV`, and `CAA` records.

## Supported DNS record types

You can use one or more of the following record types:

### A Record
Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.

```json
{
  "record": {
    "A": ["192.0.2.1"]
  }
}
```

### AAAA Record
Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.

```json
{
  "record": {
    "AAAA": ["2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334"]
  }
}
```

### CNAME Record
Points one domain name to another (alias).

```json
{
  "record": {
    "CNAME": "yourusername.github.io"
  }
}
```

### MX Record
Specifies mail servers for handling email on the domain.

```json
{
  "record": {
    "MX": ["10 mail.example.com"]
  }
}
```

### TXT Record
Stores arbitrary text data, often used for verification.

```json
{
  "record": {
    "TXT": ["v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all"]
  }
}
```

### SRV Record
Defines the location of servers for specific services (e.g., VoIP, IM).

```json
{
  "record": {
    "SRV": ["_sip._tcp.example.com 0 5 5060 sipserver.example.com"]
  }
}
```

### CAA Record
Specifies which certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for the domain.

```json
{
  "record": {
    "CAA": ["0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\""]
  }
}
```

You can also combine multiple record types:

```json
{
  "record": {
    "A": ["192.0.2.1"],
    "TXT": ["project-verification=xyz"],
    "CAA": ["0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\""]
  }
}
```

## Optional: Proxy setting

Some domains may support proxying (e.g., through Cloudflare). If so, you can add:

```json
{
  "proxy": true
}
```

> Note: Proxying behavior depends on the domain and our DNS setup. If it's unsupported, this field will be ignored.

## Full examples

### GitHub Pages

```json
{
  "owner": {
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  },
  "record": {
    "CNAME": "janedoe.github.io"
  }
}
```

### Vercel app

```json
{
  "owner": {
    "email": "sam@example.com"
  },
  "record": {
    "CNAME": "myproject.vercel.app"
  }
}
```

### Custom server

```json
{
  "owner": {
    "email": "contact@tanvir.io"
  },
  "record": {
    "A": ["93.184.216.34"]
  }
}
```

## Good to know

- Only one domain per config file.
- Your subdomain request will be reviewed before it goes live.
- Submitting a malformed JSON will delay processing — use a JSON validator if needed.
- You can always update your config by submitting a new pull request.
